# dotfiles

This is more tailored to my specific Arch install. It might not fit everyone's
environment. There are a couple of required utilities listed below. I will try
to keep them updated.

* gvim
* neovim (for quick edits without any config)
* bumblebee-status (for i3)
* mutt
* i3
* xfce4-notifyd
* blueman
* ibus
* xbacklight
* pactl
* vim-plugins group in Arch
* emacs
